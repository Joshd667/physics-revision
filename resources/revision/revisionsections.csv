3.1.1,SI Units and Measurements,"""<h3>Key Concepts</h3><p>The International System of Units (SI) provides a consistent framework for scientific measurement. Understanding the seven base units is fundamental to all physics calculations.</p><h4>The Seven SI Base Units</h4><ul><li><strong>Length:</strong> metre (m) - defined by the distance light travels in vacuum in 1/299,792,458 seconds</li><li><strong>Mass:</strong> kilogram (kg) - defined by Planck's constant</li><li><strong>Time:</strong> second (s) - defined by cesium-133 atomic transitions</li><li><strong>Electric Current:</strong> ampere (A) - defined by elementary charge</li><li><strong>Temperature:</strong> kelvin (K) - defined by Boltzmann constant</li><li><strong>Amount of Substance:</strong> mole (mol) - defined by Avogadro constant</li><li><strong>Luminous Intensity:</strong> candela (cd) - defined by luminous efficacy</li></ul>""",Standard form: a × 10ⁿ where 1 ≤ a < 10|Unit conversion: new value = old value × conversion factor,Confusing mass (kg) with weight (N)|Incorrect prefix conversions|Not using standard form appropriately
3.1.2,Errors and Uncertainties,"""<h3>Key Concepts</h3><p>Understanding and quantifying uncertainties is crucial for reliable scientific measurements. Errors can be systematic or random, and each requires different treatment.</p><h4>Types of Errors</h4><ul><li><strong>Systematic Errors:</strong> Consistent bias in measurements due to faulty equipment or method</li><li><strong>Random Errors:</strong> Unpredictable variations in repeated measurements</li></ul><h4>Uncertainty Calculations</h4><ul><li>Absolute uncertainty: ±value in same units as measurement</li><li>Percentage uncertainty: (uncertainty/measurement) × 100%</li><li>Combining uncertainties follows specific rules for different operations</li></ul>""",Addition/subtraction: add absolute uncertainties|Multiplication/division: add percentage uncertainties|Powers: multiply percentage uncertainty by the power,Mixing absolute and percentage uncertainties|Not considering significant figures|Forgetting to square uncertainties when squaring quantities
3.1.3,Estimation and Orders of Magnitude,"""<h3>Key Concepts</h3><p>Order of magnitude estimates help develop physical intuition and check the reasonableness of calculations.</p><h4>Estimation Techniques</h4><ul><li>Round numbers to nearest power of 10</li><li>Break complex problems into simpler components</li><li>Use known reference values</li><li>Check final answers for physical reasonableness</li></ul>""",Order of magnitude: express as 10ⁿ|Estimation: use powers of 10 and known values,Being too precise in estimates|Not checking reasonableness of final answers|Forgetting to convert to appropriate units
